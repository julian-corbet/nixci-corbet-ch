# Verify every upstream coordinate in ../lib/systems.nix against the registry or chart repository it
# names -- and, with --tags, show what upstream is actually shipping.
#
# WHAT THIS EXISTS TO CATCH. The cluster catalogue names container image REPOSITORIES and Helm chart
# COORDINATES, and deliberately no versions at all: a version is a value, supplied by whoever
# declares a workload. So there is nothing here that a Nix evaluation could check. What can go stale
# is the coordinate itself -- a project moves its images to a different registry, a chart repository
# is renamed, a vendor stops publishing one -- and every one of those is a fact about the world that
# changes without this repository changing.
#
# IT HAS ALREADY EARNED ITS PLACE. The first run of this script disproved a claim that had been
# written into the catalogue by hand: that one project published no container image at a coordinate
# worth recording. It publishes one, with about a hundred and seventy tags -- every one of them a
# commit hash, with no `latest` and no release-shaped tag anywhere. Both halves of that went into
# the entry, and the second half is the more useful one. That is the whole argument for checking
# coordinates against the world instead of against memory.
#
# A `null` image on an image-delivered entry is reported as ABSENT rather than skipped. No entry
# records one today (a check asserts that), so an ABSENT row means somebody added an entry without a
# coordinate.
#
# Reads the coordinates out of the catalogue rather than a second hand-kept list, which is the whole
# reason this is a script and not a checklist.
#
# Usage:
#   ./verify-upstream-coordinates.sh            # every coordinate, reachable or not
#   ./verify-upstream-coordinates.sh --tags 5   # ... and the five most recent tags of each, which is
#                                               #     how the commit-hash finding above turned up
#
# Needs: nix, jq, and skopeo for anything OCI. curl for classic chart repositories.
