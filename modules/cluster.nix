#
# nixci's cluster surface: declare what the continuous-integration platform runs, and render it.
#
# ── THIS MODULE DOES NOT IMPLEMENT KUBERNETES, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN ─────────────────────
#
# There is a sibling repository whose entire subject is the app grammar -- an app declares WHAT IT
# NEEDS (an image, ports, an exposure class, which existing claims or node paths hold its state,
# which existing Secrets it consumes) and that grammar renders the Argo CD Application, the
# Namespace, the Deployment and the Service. Everything this module can express in those terms is
# expressed in them: it DEFINES INTO `nixk3s.apps` and renders no Kubernetes object of its own.
#
# So this module is a translator, not a renderer. What it adds is the one thing the grammar cannot
# know: what a CI platform IS. Which port a forge listens on and which directory it writes its own
# instance secret into; which two ports a CI server serves and which of them agents dial; that a
# cache serves its store READ-ONLY; that a warm runner is the single writer of its own store; and
# which of two planes each of those belongs to.
#
# IMPORT THE GRAMMAR ALONGSIDE THIS MODULE. `nixk3s.apps` is declared there, not here, and a render
# that composes this module without it fails with "the option `nixk3s.apps' does not exist". That
# is a hard requirement rather than an optional integration, and it is deliberately not softened: a
# version of this module that quietly rendered its own Deployments when the grammar was absent
# would be the second implementation this repository exists to not have.
#
# ── THE CONTROL/EXECUTION AXIS IS THE STRUCTURE OF THIS FILE ───────────────────────────────────
#
# One question decides everything here: DOES REPO CODE RUN IN THIS WORKLOAD?
#
#   CONTROL PLANE    the forge, the CI server, the cache, a runner controller, a schedule. They
#                    hold the platform's credentials -- the forge's OAuth client secret, the
#                    server's admin token, the shared agent secret in full.
#   EXECUTION PLANE  every runner, and the warm builder. Pipeline steps run here, as processes in
#                    the pod or as pods it creates. This is where untrusted code executes.
#
# THE SEPARATION IS STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN ADVISORY, and it is worth listing exactly how, because
# "we documented the boundary" is how every boundary is eventually crossed:
#
#   1. A WORKLOAD'S PLANE IS NOT DECLARABLE. It is read from the catalogue entry, because which
#      plane a piece of software belongs in is a property of the software.
#   2. THERE IS NO `namespace` OPTION ANYWHERE. A workload's namespace is its PLANE's namespace,
#      and the two namespaces are two defaultless platform options that must differ. So a runner
#      cannot be moved next to the server by editing one line -- there is no line.
#   3. AN EXECUTION-PLANE WORKLOAD HAS NO `exposure` AND NO `slot` OPTION AT ALL. Writing either
#      is "the option does not exist", not a warning. And every execution-plane catalogue entry
#      declares zero ports, which is what makes the grammar render NO SERVICE for it: nothing in
#      this repository can give a workload that runs repo code an inbound address.
#   4. A SECRET NAME MAY NOT APPEAR ON BOTH PLANES. That is the load-bearing invariant of the whole
#      repository and it fails eval, naming the Secret and both workloads. The control plane's
#      credential set is a superset of the execution plane's by content and DISJOINT from it by
#      object: the server and the runner share one secret VALUE and never one Secret.
#   5. THE ONLY THING THAT CROSSES IS AN OUTBOUND DIAL, and this module COMPUTES it. A runner's
#      server address is built from the server it serves and the control namespace -- so nobody
#      writes a cross-plane address by hand, and the direction is fixed by construction.
#
# ── THE TWO THINGS THE GRAMMAR CANNOT EXPRESS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   1. A CHART DELIVERY. A runner controller ships as its vendor's Helm chart -- custom resource
#      definitions, RBAC, webhooks and a Deployment, versioned together by people who are not us.
#      The grammar renders a Deployment from an image, which is not that.
#   2. A SCHEDULE. `nixci.jobs` is work that fires on a timer. The grammar renders a Deployment for
#      every app, unconditionally, so it cannot express a workload that is not a running process.
#
# Both land on `applications.<name>` -- the RENDERER's own term, one level below the grammar --
# with their object text taken as a value (`manifests`). `nixci.renderedDirectly` lists every
# workload that took that route, so the untyped side of the platform is COUNTABLE.
#
# SERVER-SIDE APPLY IS NOT OPTIONAL ON THOSE, and the reason is a hard limit rather than a
# preference: a controller's custom resource definitions are large enough that a client-side apply
# overruns the 262144-byte annotation Kubernetes keeps the last-applied state in, and the apply
# simply fails. Server-side diff comes with it, because comparing a client-side reconstruction of a
# large resource against what the API server holds produces permanent phantom drift.
#
# ── AND ONE THING THAT RENDERS NOTHING AT ALL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A forge somebody else runs. `delivery = "reference"` produces no object of any kind, and the
# declaration exists to be checked against: a runner may name it, a server may authenticate against
# it, and the platform's report can say the dependency is there. A model that could only name what
# it deploys would not make the remote forge go away -- it would only make it invisible.
#
# ONE NAMESPACE. Everything declared here lives under `nixci`, like every repo in this family.

        the layers underneath map it into however many address spaces the fleet keeps, which is

        forge it authenticates through. Which RANGE the numbers may come from is a different
        question, answered by the band model -- see `nixci.platform.origin`.
