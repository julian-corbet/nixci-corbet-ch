# nixci's client policy: the selection surface for ../lib/clients.nix, and the package-name lists a
# host's own reconciler consumes. Installs nothing itself.
#
# THIS MODULE IS ALSO THE ARCH BACKEND, and there is deliberately no second file behind
# `systemManagerModules.default`. On Arch there is nothing here to install FROM -- the lists below
# are published and the host's own pacman reconciler consumes them -- so an `arch.nix` whose entire
# body was `imports = [ ./clients.nix ];` would be a file that exists to be an indirection.
#
#   nixarch.packages.pacman = config.nixci.clients.archPackages;
#   nixarch.packages.aur    = config.nixci.clients.aurPackages;
#
# PUBLISHED, NOT WIRED, and that is a choice rather than an omission: a host almost always
# concatenates several catalogues into one reconciler list, and a module that assigned into a
# FOREIGN namespace would both hard-depend on that namespace existing and take the concatenation
# point away from the one file that can see every catalogue at once.
#
# EVERY GROUP IS EMPTY TODAY. `types.enum [ ]` accepts no value at all, so a selection into an empty
# group is refused at eval rather than silently resolving to nothing -- which is the behaviour that
# makes an empty catalogue a state rather than a trap.
#
# ONE NAMESPACE. Everything declared here lives under `nixci`, like every repo in this family; the
# client surface is nested at `nixci.clients` so it cannot collide with the cluster surface
# (`nixci.forges` / `nixci.servers` / `nixci.caches` / `nixci.controllers` / `nixci.runners` /
# `nixci.jobs`) that shares the namespace.
