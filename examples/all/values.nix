# Placeholder values for the cluster module — the file that makes the render check real.
# `nix flake check` renders the whole platform from here, so a module that stops evaluating, or that
# grows a required value nobody supplies, fails in CI rather than in somebody's cluster.
#
# NOTHING HERE IS REAL. Every namespace, path, name, number, URL and image is invented for this
# file, and no credential appears in any form — only the NAMES of Secrets that would hold them.
#
# The declarations are chosen to cover the paths that differ in what gets RENDERED rather than
# merely in what evaluates, and above all to put BOTH PLANES in one render:
#
#   - a hosted forge, anchoring the control namespace, on node-path state, reachable to people;
#   - a forge somebody else runs, which renders nothing at all and is still declared;
#   - a CI server, above the forge it authenticates through, with the four-variable forge coupling
#     and four credential roles in one control-plane Secret;
#   - a cache, pinned by digest, whose store is mounted read-only because the catalogue says so;
#   - a runner controller, delivered as whole objects, in the CONTROL plane;
#   - a warm builder, anchoring the EXECUTION namespace, on its own Secret, with warm caches and a
#     server address nobody wrote down;
#   - an ephemeral runner pool for the remote forge, bound back to the controller across the planes;
#   - a schedule, which is not a running process and so is delivered as an object.
