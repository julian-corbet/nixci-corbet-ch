# Evaluates modules/clients.nix for real against `lib.evalModules` and asserts what it resolves,
# plus the integrity of both catalogues and the direction of the reference between them.
#
# Here for the reason every sibling states for its own version of this file: `nix flake check` does
# not evaluate `nixosModules`/`systemManagerModules` on its own, so a green check on this repository
# without it would prove nothing but flake syntax.
#
# ── WHAT IT PROVES TODAY, GIVEN AN EMPTY CLIENT CATALOGUE ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# Two of the sections below are real and one quantifies over an empty set, and the file says which
# is which rather than reading as though all of it were exercised:
#
#   - REAL: the resolution path terminates -- every plane a backend reads is published and empty;
#     every group is declared and refuses a name; and the CLUSTER catalogue's integrity, which is
#     where all the content in this repository actually is.
#   - EMPTY-SET: the pacman/AUR invariant and the nixpkgs-null handling. They hold vacuously and
#     they are kept, because the day an entry lands they become the checks that matter and
#     rediscovering them then is how a converge gets broken.
#
# THE TRIPWIRE is the point of the file in the meantime: `the client catalogue claims no package`
# fails the moment somebody adds one, so the empty-set assertions above cannot stay vacuous without
# anybody noticing, and this header cannot stay true without being edited.
#
# Deliberately pkgs-FREE beyond `pkgs.emptyFile` for the derivation shell. Every question here is a
# question about NAMES and LISTS. Whether a name is in a repository today, and whether a nixpkgs
# attribute still forces, are facts about the world that change without this repository changing --
# see ../experiments/verify-upstream-coordinates.sh.
